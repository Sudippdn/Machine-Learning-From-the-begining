## Introduction: 

Arthur Samuel popularized the term `Machine Learning`. Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn, gradually improving their accuracy.

There are two main types of Machine Learning algorithms. They are:
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning

The other types of machine learning algorithms are:
- Recommender system
- Reinforcement learning

# 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where the model learns from labeled data or right answer. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset that consists of input-output pairs, where the input data is accompanied by corresponding correct output labels. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function from input to output so that it can predict the output for new, unseen input data. 

There are two type of supervised learning which are:
i. Regression - Housing Price Prediction
ii. Classification - Finding out if lump is benign or malignant

Difference between Regression and Classification

1. - Regression tries to predict any number from infinitely mant no of possible numbers.
   - Classification Only tries to predict either 0 or 1

2. - Classification: Infinitely large no of possible output
   - Regression: Predict categories of small no of possible outputs
