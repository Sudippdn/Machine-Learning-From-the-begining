# **Machine Learning Full Course**

## Introduction: 

Arthur Samuel popularized the term `Machine Learning`. Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn, gradually improving their accuracy.

There are two main types of Machine Learning algorithms. They are:
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning

The other types of machine learning algorithms are:
3. Recommender system
4. Reinforcement learning

# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a machine learning algorithm where models learns its data from labeled data. Supervised learning is used in the real world. The few applications of supervised learning are:
- Regression: Housing price prediction
- Find out if lump is malignant or benign

The applications of supervised learning algorithms can be achieved with the help of the following types of supervised learning algorithms.
